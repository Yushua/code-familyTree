 Create a game where you make 50 people. each have a proffession. and then see them grow and get children

this is to learn continues system that can be used for different things.

for example, when making the space game, the characters on the ship are going to do things. they sleep, they learn,they improve the ship, they form relationships. etc.

this underside is the first step on that system

- first step: easy to understand. randomiser based on name and last name. there is a chance based on each proffession what that last name is.

the input is a number. and then the people

- step 2. have a month process. each year is 12 months. update someone when its their birthday

perosn has

- name
- birthday
- last name
- partner
- children
- profesion

step 3
- > at certain age (+17) they have a chance to get married. only once.
- > then they can get kids. kids take 9 months to be born. kid is then created.
- > kid grows as well and has kids
- > at a certain age a person dies

step 4

- > person has additional things. at a certain age they get a proffession when a kid.
- > proffesion can kill them, chance of dying
- > doctor proffesion can save them
- > if doctor full, person doesn't get help


---

now there are multiple things one can do.
- divorce
- expertise
- bad attributes like drunk, mental illness
- deformaties

then money
- when at a job they get paid, when they go up at their proffession, they get more money
- if they lsoe their job, they might find another
- if they're out of money they might get homeless
- when homeless implimented, they need to pay for their home. have the family check of they can PAY for a home.
- for now, if kid has a job AND can pay for it, they live on their own, lose family.
if homeless, they can try to get back to their parents (chance of success, for example, f they can't pay. sorry. if they can. chance of success)
